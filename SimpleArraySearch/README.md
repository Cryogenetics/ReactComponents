# Simple Array Search

## this is a simple modular searchbar that can filter through an array of objects.

this was my first time using typescript, and still kind of new to react.
an example of the searchbar can be found in [exampleUsage.tsx](https://github.com/Cryogenetics/ReactComponents/blob/main/SimpleArraySearch/exampleUsage.tsx)

the searchbar was made using nextui and for the Icons in the example @mui/icons-material was used
```bash
npm i @nextui/react @mui/icons-material
```

known issues:
- finiky behavior when search is empty and attempting to change sorting or order
